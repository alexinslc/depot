# Depot
 
* This is my repo for the `depot` application from [Agile Web Development with Rails 7](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/) by Sam Ruby.

### Why Agile Web Development with Rails 7? 

* I recently completed the [Learn Ruby on Rails for Beginners](https://gorails.com/start) course offered by Chris Oliver. It is a great introduction to Ruby and Rails and I highly recommend it. It has been a while since I've jumped into Ruby and Rails. I've followed Agile Web Development with Rails book in the past (older edition) and I was very impressed with what I learned. This is a refresher for me with all the new Rails stuff! 

 ### Other Info 

* Ruby version - 3.1.1
* Rails version - 7.0.2.3
