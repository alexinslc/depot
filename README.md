### Why Agile Web Development with Rails 7? 

* I recently completed the [Learn Ruby on Rails for Beginners](https://gorails.com/start) course offered by Chris Oliver. It is a great introduction to Ruby and Rails and I highly recommend it. It has been a while since I've jumped into Ruby and Rails. I've followed Agile Web Development with Rails book in the past (older edition) and I was very impressed with what I learned. This is a refresher for me with all the new Rails stuff! 

 ### Other Info 

* Use `bin/dev` to run the application locally. (Not `rails s`)
* Use `bin/rails dbconsole` to access the SQLite database.
* Use `bin/rails test` to run the tests.
* Use `bin/rails test:models` to run the tests for the models. 
* Use `bin/rails db:test:prepare` to prepare the database for testing. (usually done automatically)
